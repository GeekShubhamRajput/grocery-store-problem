Consider a supermarket like Big Bazaar where they sell items by quantity and if a customer purchases more quantities, then the discounts will be applied to some items.

Item                      Unit price        Discounted price
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bread                     Rs. 60            3 for Rs. 150
Eggs                       Rs. 40            2 for Rs. 70
Milk                        Rs. 60
Tea                         Rs. 150

At the billing counter, the items are accepted in any order. For example, the order can be Eggs, Milk, Tea, Eggs, Eggs. Over here, the quantity of eggs is 3 and so the total price for eggs is calculated as follows: 
1. For the first two eggs, the price would be Rs.70
2. For the 3rd egg, the price would be Rs 40.
So, the total price for eggs would be Rs. 110.

Build a ruby program which will take input as the items separated by a comma and will calculate and print the total price and savings.

Sample input string: Eggs,eggs,bread,milk,tea,bread,bread,bread,milk

Item               Quantity       Price
-------------------------------------------
Bread                  4              Rs. 210
Eggs                   2              Rs. 70
Milk                   2              Rs. 120
Tea                    1              Rs. 150

Total price : Rs. 550
Savings: Rs. 40
